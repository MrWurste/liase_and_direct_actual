This repository is the backend part of a web application that allows bosses to send announcements to employees and facilitates simple messaging between all members of the company.
However, this app requires a lot of work to meet my standards. I need to properly handle CORS, which is currently disabled for demo purposes. I also need to implement message sorting,
user profiles, and chat rooms. But there is one thing that I don't have, and that's time.

Currently, I am studying IT at Academia WSEI in Lublin, which requires a lot of my attention. Additionally, I have had a lot of problems with my previous job, which has negatively
impacted my mental health. Don't worry, it was not my fault. I was a good employee. The problem was with the higher positioned workers and the boss himself. He doesn't care about his
company, and his and menagers poor decisions have ruined the entire company. As a result, I have lost thousands of zlotys for my unpaid work.

But I assure you, this project will continue. Perhaps slowly, but surely.
